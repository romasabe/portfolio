              <p>I decided to research Software developers because I think the technical
                side of computers is very interesting. I like finding interesting solutions
                to problems and enjoy a challenge. I feel like programming and creating automated
                programs to do tasks is something that I would be interested in being in charge of.
                Applications and making something that can be useful to someone also is something I am interested in.
                I use apps every day and actually creating them would be very fufilling.

              <p>You typically need a bachelors degree to become a
                Software Engineer at an entry level. You would need bachelors degrees
                in software development, computer science, or another computer science related
                degree. Companies highering Software developers tend to want to hire people
                with experience in the field, ones that have earned certifications, or have
                completed training programs such as a bootcamp. On the left you can see two Universities
                with very prestigious computer science programs.
