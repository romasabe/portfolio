          <p>If I ever have freetime then I am usually playing video games. I have always connected with others
            through video games. My dad introduced me to Minecraft when I was 5 and ever since then I've never
            looked back. Here are some of my favorite video games.

            <li class="list-group-item"><h3>Favorite Song:</h3> SORRY NOT SORRY</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">My favorite thing about Tyler's music is how he is able to bring in many different influences
              and create a cohesive beautiful piece. Tyler makes mostly hip hop music but dabbles in RnB and more indie music. His lyrics
              are also very unique to him. It feels like only he can be the one saying what he's saying. In my favorite song of his, SORRY NOT SORRY,
              Tyler goes over all of his regrets throughout his years of fame and apologizes for anything he's ever done. That song gives me chills.
              It feels like he has been waiting to get this off his chest for the longest time.

            <li class="list-group-item"><h3>Favorite Song:</h3> Empire Ants (feat. Little Dragon)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"> Gorillaz is a virtual band created by Damon Albarn, the front man of Blur. Gorillaz has one of the most diverse
              discographies out of any band. Gorillaz is a mix of rock, pop, and electronica with many hip hop influences. They collaborate with rappers fairly often
              My favorite album by them, Plastic Beach has all of these genres mixed within but has this extra cinematic effect. There are many orchestral sections That
              that have some of the most beautiful melodies i've ever heard. Empire Ants has this same effect. Especially when Little Dragon comes in at the end and begins singing with
              a euphoric drop playing behind her.

            <li class="list-group-item"><h3>Favorite Song:</h3> HAZARD DUTY PAY!</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">JPEGMAFIA, also known as Peggy, is one of the most fun artists I've ever heard. His music is so creative that it's hard to describe.
              It's hardcore Hip-Hop with the most interesting samples you will ever hear. HAZARD DUTY PAY! has a soul sample that plays throughout the track that sounds so good
              with the booming beat that goes along with it. Peggy's almost screaming vocals add to the hype of this track. Whenever I want to be hyped up,
              I turn on Peggy's music and I instantly become motivated and energized. Peggy is also very versatile as an artist. He can sing, rap, and produce. Peggy
              has made some beautiful tracks also. Free the Frail (feat. Helena Deland) has a beautiful and introspective chorus that reflects on Peggy's career as a musician.
