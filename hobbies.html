        <p>If I ever have freetime then I am usually playing video games. I have always connected with others
          through video games. My dad introduced me to Minecraft when I was 5 and ever since then I've never
          looked back. Here are some of my favorite video games.

          <li class="list-group-item">Outer Wilds is a space exploration game set in a dying star system. You are a
            species that is
            trying to find out the history of the species that lived in the area before. Outer Wilds is a game that you
            experience on your own
            It's all about exploration and investigation. You are encouraged to read everything and peice together what
            wiped out the species that came before you.
            Outer Wilds is not only an experience but also just a fun game to play. The added time loop mechanic makes
            the experience that much more exciting.

            <h3>My Rating: 9/10</h3>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">While Outer wilds is a very story based game, Neon White is not. Neon White is a
            shooter platformer
            that focuses on going fast. You are actively encouraged and required to complete each level quickly. The
            game rewards
            with you medals when reaching certain time markers. Beating the developer's time for each level also earns
            you a medal.
            The game gives you many incentives to keep playing and the main gameplay loop is very fun and doesn't get
            tiring. Neon White
            is just pure fun.

          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">If you don't know what portal is, it's a puzzle game centered around using portals
            to move throughout levels,
            manipulate objects, and abuse their physics. Each level is challenging but not rage inducing. It's fun to
            mess around with portals
            and progress toward solving the puzzle. The story is also very interesting. I never beat portal 1 and
            although this is a continuation
            of that story. You don't need to play Portal 1 to understand the story. The voice acting in this game is
            very impressive and the story itself is funny
            and engaging. Overall fun game.

        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>I've always had a facination for music. I like listening to how the instrumentals and vocals of tracks mix
          and digging into
          the back end of the music. I genuinely love listening to music and discovering new music. I find that people
          using both their lyrics
          and the instrumentals that they create to evoke emotion facinating. It's so cool what music can do for
          people.

            <h3>Favorite Song:</h3> SORRY NOT SORRY
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">My favorite thing about Tyler's music is how he is able to bring in many
            different influences
            and create a cohesive beautiful piece. Tyler makes mostly hip hop music but dabbles in RnB and more indie
            music. His lyrics
            are also very unique to him. It feels like only he can be the one saying what he's saying. In my favorite
            song of his, SORRY NOT SORRY,
            Tyler goes over all of his regrets throughout his years of fame and apologizes for anything he's ever
            done. That song gives me chills.
            It feels like he has been waiting to get this off his chest for the longest time.

            <h3>Favorite Song:</h3> Empire Ants (feat. Little Dragon)
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item"> Gorillaz is a virtual band created by Damon Albarn, the front man of Blur.
            Gorillaz has one of the most diverse
            discographies out of any band. Gorillaz is a mix of rock, pop, and electronica with many hip hop
            influences. They collaborate with rappers fairly often
            My favorite album by them, Plastic Beach has all of these genres mixed within but has this extra cinematic
            effect. There are many orchestral sections That
            that have some of the most beautiful melodies i've ever heard. Empire Ants has this same effect.
            Especially when Little Dragon comes in at the end and begins singing with
            a euphoric drop playing behind her.

            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">JPEGMAFIA, also known as Peggy, is one of the most fun artists I've ever heard.
              His music is so creative that it's hard to describe.
              It's hardcore Hip-Hop with the most interesting samples you will ever hear. HAZARD DUTY PAY! has a soul
              sample that plays throughout the track that sounds so good
              with the booming beat that goes along with it. Peggy's almost screaming vocals add to the hype of this
              track. Whenever I want to be hyped up,
              I turn on Peggy's music and I instantly become motivated and energized. Peggy is also very versatile as an
              artist. He can sing, rap, and produce. Peggy
              has made some beautiful tracks also. Free the Frail (feat. Helena Deland) has a beautiful and
              introspective chorus that reflects on Peggy's career as a musician.
