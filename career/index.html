              <h1>Why Software Development?</h1>
              <p>I decided to research Software developers because I think the technical
                side of computers is very interesting. I like finding interesting solutions
                to problems and enjoy a challenge. I feel like programming and creating automated
                programs to do tasks is something that I would be interested in being in charge of.
                Applications and making something that can be useful to someone also is something I am interested in.
                I use apps every day and actually creating them would be very fufilling.
